The :run <filename>; command opens the named file and begins
running the commands just as if they were typed at the prompt.
All commands are supported, including nested :run commands
so infinite recursion is possible!
Batches are executed when the cmdEnd ("go") is read so this
behaves differently from the original ':r <batchFile>' command.
When the file is exhausted or 'quit' is read, control is
returned to the calling command file or prompt.
NOTE: 'exit' will cause Misql to exit.
      No other settings are restored on return.
