MISQL support two types of output:
By default output is sent to System.out or to a file if the '-o <filename>'
option was given on the command line.
Output from a single batch command can be redirected using to a file using:
'>' or '>>' (append) after the "cmdEnd" terminator eg:
 go > myFile
will send the output from the batch to myFile and not to the normal output
device.

In addition the commands:
:log on <fileName>; or :log append <filename>;
  will begin copying all output to 'fileName' until turned off using:
:log off|close;

Input commands can be written back out to the output device and
log file if the '-e' command line option is given or it has been set using
:set echo on; command.
