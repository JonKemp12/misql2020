The set command supports the following:
:set echo|EC on|off;   - Output commands to output devices.
:set header|HD on|off; - Output result set column name headings on or off.
:set footer|FT on|off; - Output result set footers ("rows affected")on or off.
:set colTerm|CT <string>; - Set column terminator string
	If not set, columns are padded with space to preserve formatting
	otherwise each column (except the last)is terminated with this string.
	Supports newline (\n) and tab (\t). 
:set rowTerm|RT <string>; - set the last column terminator string.
:set dispWidth|DW <n>; - Set the required display width for formatting 
    output results.
:set maxColWidth|CW <n>; - Set a maximum width for character type columns 
   (default 512 as ISQL).
:set verticalRows|VR <n>|off;
	Row results are output in vertical rows, if 'header' is on, the first 
	column is the column name. Rows are 'squeezed' such that <n> rows fit into
	the 'dispWidth' across the screen. 'colTerm' and 'rowTerm' are also used.
	Also, can use special batch executor command:
vgo <n> which will execute the batch with vertical rows on for this batch only
    and then reverse back to previous setting.
:set prompt[1]|PR[P1] <string>; - Set MISQL prompt to <string>.
	<string> can contain any string including newline (\n) and tab (\t).
	'prompt1' string is used when the batch line number is 1.
	'prompt' is used for all other lines (and if prompt1 is NOT set).
	MISQL local variables can be included:
		@{lineNo}   - batch line number.
		@{batchNo}	- current batch number.
		@{dbName}   - current connection's current database context.
		@{connName} - current connection's name
		@{userName} - username of the current connection
		@{server}   - server name of the current connection
		@{time}     - system time at the time of output.
*:set colList|CL <column list>; - Set a list of columns to be included in the 
    resultset display. <column list> is a comma separated list of column names
    or column numbers which will control the order and content of each result
    set returned by the batch. (Not yet implemented.)
:set history|HI <n>; - Set history length (default = 20)
